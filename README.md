# Tulok Reborn
This is a dashboard like tool to quickly view all relevant info about courses I am currently taking. It is written in Rust using the tui-rs library.


The point of this application is to integrate tasks view along with quickly opening notes and random course related files. Additionally this app served as a learning project for both Rust as well as the tui-rs crate.

Note that this project is only public as it is technically part of my dotfiles. This code is written by someone learning the language and thus in no way idiomatic. 

In the future parts of this code might be changed to either add, change or remove functionality. Additionally this version of the code is not at all robust, having for example unwraps all over the place. The app is currently in a working state so it will be left as is for now but in the future it might be rewritten such that most if not all of the unwraps are removed.
